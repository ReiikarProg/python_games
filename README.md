# README

This repository contains 2D games programmed in python using pygame.

Currently, it contains two separated files :

- The file Shooter contains all the recquired data to play a short game in which you control a spacship and you have to destroy/avoid incomming ennemies for a few waves before you enter the boss level. At the end, you can access you score depending on how much ennemies you have kille. This project is over.

- The file Rakimon contains is still on developpment. The goal is to create a Pokemon-like RPG game, using both pygame and tiled to create the maps. Actually, it contains the following features :

   1. Creation of the Hero that can move within a few maps (7) and access some basic building. The game also take into account all collisions between the Heor and the decor.
   2. The main menu can be accessed but only a few things are up to work, like the BAG.
   3. While exiting the game, the program save your current position on a given map as well as your BAG content. It is then reload while re-starting the game. However, the "START NEW GAME"     
      option is not ready yet.
   4. I am currently working on battle managment.
